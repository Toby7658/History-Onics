# User Experience UX

## User Interaction
The aim of this site is to provide a one-stop source for knowledge of the country of Ireland. This is an informational site
and is designed so as the user can access all information, both historical and touristic, without the need to search elsewhere.
Although an informational website, the user can interact by social media and a contact page. As the site is responsive on all screens, the user can access the site while travelling and can keep returning as they navigate their way around Ireland. The site 
is designed for the user to have quick access to information as they need it, including maps, brief descriptions and videos of each area. 

## User Stories
* As a user, I want a website which provides easy access tourist information for the whole of Ireland.
* As a user, I want a website which provides video information and maps to assist with locating areas and places of interest.
* As a user, I want to easily navigate to each county and learn about the areas.
* As a user, I want to learn more about the website providers.
* As a user, I want to have access to the site social media.
* As a user, I want a site which allows me to repeat visit for information as I travel around each county of Ireland.
* As a user, I want to have the ability to contact the site for information and queries.

## Wireframe
The mock-up for this project was created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/).
Aspects of the mock-up have changed during production due to increasing user experience and 
visual effects. Changes include moving the Logo to the centre and creating a Nav menu bar
which is replaced by a Hamburger bar as devices become smaller.

# Structure of Site
The site is made up of eight pages. They are constructed of:
1. * [Home page](index.html)
2. * [Visit Munster page](munster.html)
3. * [Visit Connacht page](connacht.html)
4. * [Visit Leinster page](leinster.html)
5. * [Visit Ulster page](ulster.html)
6. * [About Us page](about.html)
7. * [Contact Us page](contact.html)
8. * [Submit page](submit.html)

The site opens with a landing page that presents a [Hero Image](./assets/images/hero-image.jpeg) with a zoom effect. For wide screens, there is a navigation menu on the top right-hand side. This turns into a hamburger bar for smaller screens and is placed on the left of the screen. The logo is also used as a navigational tool on each page to bring the user
back to the landing page. The nav bars are provided on each page, except the submission page, to guide the user and are responsive on all screen sizes.

The centre structure of the page provides a short introduction to the site. The heading used for this piece also incorporates fixed
icons of a person strolling, this is to complement the title 'A Stroll Back In Time'. 
At the bottom of the landing page is also another navigation block which is broken into four separate 
images with access to four separate pages. The images change colour to grayscale when hovered over to allow
the user to know which block they are choosing.
The footer holds the social media icons, which are responsive on all screens throughout each page of the site.

The visit pages provide a short intro to each county with a map and youtube video guide. 
The map can be clicked upon and opened to a new window. The videos each play within the existing site page.

The About Us page introduces the user to the team and provides a brief description and biography of the 
site owners. Images of the team have also been added to the page.

The contact page provides a query box and requires the user to complete various fields including
Name, Phone, and Email. These boxes are required fields and have a * to indicate this to the user.
The email address provided by the user must be correctly structured to submit a query.

The submission page appears after the user submits a query via the contact page. The page provides a message stating that the 
query has been received. The user can then navigate away from this page by clicking on the Logo or nav bar provided.

[Back to top](<#Table-of-Contents>)

# Typography
The body of the site uses font style "Lato", "sans-serif". This is in contrast with the logo and headings which
uses the font style "Cormorant SC", "sans-serif". Initially, Cormorant SC was used throughout as the style provides 
a more ancient feel to the historic site. However, this font appears only as uppercase and therefore the body was 
replaced with Lato typeface to provide a more natural read for the user. Sans-serif is in place as a secondary default option
should either of the first options fail. Fonts were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

[Back to top](<#Table-of-Contents>)

# Colour Scheme

The colour scheme is inspired by the traditional color of Ireland, green. The shade #E2EECC was 
chosen as this colour is soft yet also provides a more ancient feel within a green tone.
The text is set as #2f4f4f, which again is in keeping with the green tones and historic feel of the site.
Grayscale has also been used when hovering over the navigational block of images at the bottom
of the landing page. To contrast against the green tone, #f1f1f1 has been used for the text on all navigation
bars and blocks. Finally, #45a049 has been used when hovering over the submit button on the contact page. 

For smaller devices, the colour scheme has changed to allow a better visual experience. The body background changes to #faebd7 
which provides a lighter background against the now #000000 text. The hamburger icon is now visible with #FF7F50 and upon opening
the menu, the background has changed to #d2691e. 

The colour scheme was guided by [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [HTML CSS Color Picker](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/).

# Existing Features

## Navigation Menu
A top navigation menu bar has been put in place for screens 950px and wider. Originally, a hamburger-bar
the menu was put in place for all screens, as this seems to be a common theme with other sites currently through further research, however, in order to show adaptability with building this site, the hamburger bar was set in place for screens smaller than 950px. This also shows the responsiveness as the screens are minimized. 
The top navigation menu bar sits at the top right-hand side of the screen and allows the user to navigate 
through seven pages (the eight-page being the submission button which cannot be accessed unless pressing 'submit' on the
contact page). Each element becomes highlighted as the user hovers over the tabs separately. This aspect was influenced
by the W3School via [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_navbar_icon.asp)

Originally the Nav bar was quite plain and lacked style. Following some sound advice and suggestions via Peer-Code-Review on Slack, the Nav bar was changed to a more visually pleasant image for the user.

![Former Navigation Menu Bar](./assets/images/documentation/nav-menu-bar.jpg)

New Nav bar which runs across the full screen:

![Updated Navigation Menu](./assets/images/documentation/nav-menu-updated.jpg)


## Hamburger Bar

A hamburger bar has been placed for small screens including tablets and mobile devices. This button sits
at the top left-hand corner of the screen and provides the user with a full list of pages, as per the top navigation menu bar.
The icon can be recognized by the three lines visible, upon the user clicking on this, the button changes colour and opens to
provide a list of pages. The X on the open tab of the menu must then be clicked to close the hamburger bar. This aspect was
influenced by [W3School Collapsed Sidepanel](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapse_sidepanel.asp).

## Logo

The logo 'HistoryOnics' is a play on words. Histrionic, meaning overly dramatic or theatrical.
is in keeping with the dramatic history and storytelling of Ireland. The font, "Cormorant SC" may
also be seen as dramatic, coupled together with colour #2f4f4f brings a bold effect, in keeping with
an Irish historical theme. Upon clicking on the logo, the user is brought back to the landing page.
The logo is responsive on all screens.

## Hero Image
The [Hero Image](./assets/images/hero-image.jpeg) is of the Cliffs of Moher and is synonymous with Ireland across the globe and presents an immediate interaction with the user with the zoom-in effect. The zoom-in effect is responsive to all wide-screen sizes. The Hero Image was sourced via [Google Images](https://images.google.com/) from [Cliffs of Moher](https://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/unesco-global-geopark/education/learning-resources/).

[Back to top](<#Table-of-Contents>)

## Navigation Blocks

The navigational block is provided for further interaction with the user. The user can hover over each image, which will then become grayscale, and upon clicking on the chosen box, the user will be directed to the chosen page. Famous aspects of each province have been used for imagery with bright colours to further attract the user visually. This block is responsive to all screens.Images are sourced via [Google Images](https://images.google.com/) via: [Connacht Image](https://theplanetd.com/poulnabrone-dolmen-ireland/), [Munster Image](https://www.atlanticwaytouring.com/product/quin-abbey/), [Leinster Image](https://www.meetingselect.com/en/venue/trinity-college-university-of-dublin), [Ulster Image](https://www.posterlounge.com/p/738259.html)

## Social Media
The social media icons can be accessed on all pages and will bring the user to four separate external sites
including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/). The setting of these icons has been influenced by the Love Running module
as per [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/). Icons were accessed by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

## Videos

Videos have been incorporated as part of the Visit Pages for each county within Provinces. All video material has been sourced 
via Youtube. Each video provides information as per the county it is relating to. The videos were originaly 
to be placed on the left-hand side of the page, however, this was not as visually appealing as when it is placed on the right. 
Each video is responsive on all screens and will play within the page, without increasing in size. 
Videos are sourced from:

## Bugs and Errors
1. The ALT text adds a text description to an image on a Web page, and should be used for all images, graphical bullets, and graphical horizontal rules. Initially, Alt was included in the video and map iframe, however, this brought the Lighthouse Validation score down and created errors within W3 Validator. Once this was removed, the score increased and W3 stated error free.

![W3 Validator Error](./assets/images/documentation/error-w3-validator-alt.jpg)

![W3 Validator Error-Free](./assets/images/documentation/error-w3-validator-fixed.jpg)

2. Upon adding the back button on the submit page, the button became cut off when resizing to a smaller devise:


![Button back for mobile](./assets/images/documentation/error-submitmobile-cutoff.jpg)

Issue was corrected by re-using the css for the contact page submit button:

![Button back for mobile](./assets/images/documentation/error-submitmobile-fixed.jpg)

3. When validating the Visit pages on Lighthouse, errors appeared for all iframes. It was noted that height and width 
were set as a percentage and were coming up as an error. The height and width were changed to " " which solved the immediate issue. This then caused an issue with the map overlapping with the video upon decreasing the screen size. This issue was fixed by reducing the size of the map and video for a smoother transition when resizing.
