# Structure of Site
The site is made up of eight pages. They are constructed of:
1. * [Home page](index.html)
2. * [Visit Munster page](munster.html)
3. * [Visit Connacht page](connacht.html)
4. * [Visit Leinster page](leinster.html)
5. * [Visit Ulster page](ulster.html)
6. * [About Us page](about.html)
7. * [Contact Us page](contact.html)
8. * [Submit page](submit.html)

The site opens with a landing page which presents a [Hero Image](./assets/images/hero-image.jpeg) with zoom effect. 
For wide screens, there is a navigation menu at the top right hand side. This turns into a hamburger-bar for smaller screens and is placed on the left of the screen. The logo is also used as a navigational tool on each page to bring the user
back to the landing page. The nav bars are provided on each page to guide the user and are responsive on all screen sizes.
At the bottom of the landing page is also another navigation block which is broken into four seperate 
images with access to four seperate pages. The images change colour to grayscale when hovered over to allow
the user to know which block they are choosing.
The footer holds the social media icons, which are responsive on all screens throughout each page of the site.

The visit pages provides a short intro to each county with a map and youtube video guide. 
The map can be clicked upon and opens to a new window. The videos each play within the existing site page.

The About Us page introduces the user to the team and provides a brief description and biography of the 
site owners. Images of the team have also been added to the page.

The contact page provides a query box and requires the user to complete various fields including
Name, Phone and Email. These boxes are required fields and have a * to indicate this to the user.
The email address provided by the user must be correctly structured inorder to submit a query.

The submission page appears after the user submits a query via the contact page. The page provides a message stating that the 
query has been received. The user can then navigate away from this page by clicking on the Logo or nav bar provided.

# Typography
The body of the site uses font style "Moyers typeface", "sans-serif". This is in contrast with the logo and headings which
uses font style "Cormorant SC", "sans-serif". Initially, Cormorant SC was used throughout as the style provides 
a more ancient feel to the history site. However, this font appears only as uppercase and therefore the body was 
replaced with Moyers typeface to provide a more natural read for the user. Sans-serif is inplace as a second default option
should either of the first options fail. Fonts were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

# Colour Scheme

The colour scheme is inspired by the traditional color of Ireland, green. The shade "rgb(226, 238, 204)" was 
chosen as this colour is soft yet also provides a more ancient feel within a green tone.
The text is set as #2f4f4f, which again is inkeeping with the green tones and historic feel of the site.
Grayscale has also been used when hovering over the navigational block of images at the bottom
of the landing page. To contrast against the green tone, #f1f1f1 has been used for the text on all navigation
bars and blocks. Finally, #45a049 has been used when hovering over the submit button on the contact page. 
The colour scheme was guided by [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).
